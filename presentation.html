<p>Hi, slides for this talk are available at this URL or via this QR code. For
anyone who wants to follow along with the talk.</p>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>So a bit about me. My name is Rory. I'm from Ireland, I've been in Seattle just
over 2 years now. I did an undergraduate degree in mathematics. That's where I
first dabbled in programming. After college I taught myself how to code more
seriously. I've now been working as a software engineer for the last 4 years,
mostly in full stack web development. The main languages I've worked with are
TypeScript, C#, Python, SQL, and Rust. My other hobbies include rock climbing
and skiing.</p>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I just want to give a quick overview of what I will be talking about in this
presentation. I will start off by presenting on several projects I have worked
on over the years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Namely, Atlas, a large project I worked on at my previous job.</li>
<li>A ray tracing engine that I built in Rust.</li>
<li>Some open source work that I have done.</li>
<li>And finally why I want to work at the Allen Institute and this job.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<h2 id="abbey-capital">Abbey Capital</h2>
<p>My previous job was at a company called Abbey Capital. They are a financial fund
manager, in other words they manage large sums of other people's money, deciding
on the best way to invest that money. They specialise in 'alternative
investments'. In their case mostly futures contracts, and other derivatives
based on the value of physical commodities.</p>
<p>While I was there I worked as a software engineer building and maintaining
internal tooling for the company. I started off mostly handling tickets on
existing applications but worked my way up to larger projects.</p>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<h2 id="atlas">Atlas</h2>
<p>The first project I want to talk about today is called Atlas. It was the main
project I worked on at Abbey Capital. It was a full re-build of their internal
fund accounting application. It was a web application built with a TypeScript
React frontend, C# <a href="http://ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a> on the backend, and a MySQL database. All running on
AWS.</p>
<p>I was part of a small team working on this project, there were just two of us
initially, though more people were brought on later, so I was deeply involved
with all aspects of the project. We were building this for an internal
department at the company so we had direct access to our users and I learnt a
lot from sitting with them and watching them use the software.</p>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<h3 id="atlas---functionality">Atlas - functionality</h3>
<p>The primary function of Atlas was to calculate daily profit and loss for the
funds Abbey managed. It also compared this data to various third parties to
ensure their systems were up to scratch. If it found any discrepancies it would
flag this for a user to follow up with.</p>
<p>It was designed to improve upon the existing system and automate many manual
checks that were taking place.</p>
<p>It did this for 6 different funds, each with their own rules and quirks, and
about 7bn dollars in assets.</p>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<h3 id="atlas---architecture">Atlas - architecture</h3>
<p>Just to give a little more perspective on this I have a quick diagram of the
architecture. Unfortunately I cannot actually show you the application as it is
all proprietary.</p>
<p>These are the three main layers of the application, we have the database which
stores all of the application data, a backend server, and frontend UI that users
interact with.</p>
<p>The backend server did most of the work for this application; serving the
frontend UI, running calculations on data, pushing real-time updates to users,
and communicating with other services.</p>
<p><strong>Show next step</strong></p>
<p>On that note, I should point out that Atlas was part of a larger set of
distributed services. It interacted with other services that we built like the
data ingestion tool you can see here and reporting service over here. It
generally interacted with these services via message queues and other off the
shelf AWS components.</p>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<h3 id="atlas---project-structure">Atlas - project structure</h3>
<p>The project was split into five main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specification:</strong> During specification we spent several months working with
users, to see what they were expecting from the project. Since we were
re-building an existing application we used that as a starting point, adding
in additional features and making improvements as necessary. We used a tool
(Balsamiq) to create visual mock-ups and aid in the design process. This is a
technique that I thought was extremely useful and would definitely bring to
future projects that I work on.</li>
<li><strong>Design:</strong> For the design phase we researched different options and decided
what architecture and technologies we were going to use. One of the big
criteria was to give the application a &quot;real-time&quot; feel to it. So when you
make a change to a data point in one place it automatically propagates those
changes to derived data and other users. A bit like working on a collaborative
Excel spreadsheet.</li>
<li><strong>Build:</strong> Then we started actually building the application. Once we has some
user interfaces we started doing user testing. This allowed us to use an
iterative design process and make sure we were building what our users
actually wanted.</li>
<li><strong>Parallel testing:</strong> After the main features were built we entered a period
of parallel testing. During this time we were running the new system in
parallel with the old one, validating our calculations. As this was a
financial application that would eventually send data to clients a high degree
of certainty in the data was required. We also started with full scale user
testing bringing on feedback from more people on the team. Of course this led
to many bug fixes and some minor changes.</li>
<li><strong>Production:</strong> Finally after we were satisfied with our system we turned off
the old system and Atlas took over.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<h3 id="atlas---user-feedback">Atlas - user feedback</h3>
<p>As you can imagine we received a lot of feedback from users during this project
and this has greatly influenced how I think about designing software. For the
most part the feedback we received on features was relatively obvious and easily
resolved. There were two things however that have really stuck with me from this
time, mostly because of how much controversy and discourse they stirred up.</p>
<p><strong>Show next step</strong>. Firstly, pie charts. One senior member of the team was very
much pro using pie charts extensively while some other people were vehemently
against them.</p>
<p>This led to a whole discussion on the pros and cons of pie charts and when to
use them. In the end we settled on using them sparingly throughout the
application in places where they really made sense. Fortunately this discussion
came up during the specification phase rather than at build so I didn't have go
around re-writing any code. This was a big bonus of having visual references in
the specification.</p>
<p><strong>Show next step</strong>, the second one is how to align numbers in a table. The
application made extensive use of tabulated data and one time, in a user review,
I was asked &quot;why are all the numbers right aligned, they should be centred&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Show next step</strong>, In other words why was I doing this, I should be doing this.</p>
<p>At the time I was shocked this was even a question but when I brought the query
to a wider group of users I found people very strongly entrenched on both sides.
In the end we made it a user setting so that everyone could set it up the way
they wanted.</p>
<p>What I learnt from these two instances, and countless others, is that what makes
a good user interface is extremely subjective. You should make configurable UIs
so that users can set them up the way they want them. Especially in cases where
your users are going to be using the application every day. Though I still think
it is important to have sensible defaults so that new users can get up and
running quickly.</p>
<p>There are really no right or wrong answers when it comes to UI design. So you
should get your designs in front of users as early as possible to get their
feedback.</p>
<p>Everyone will give you feedback on a design, even if they don't actually use the
application (this often includes the developers of the application). So you
should prioritize actual users over others where appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<h3 id="atlas---my-contributions">Atlas - my contributions</h3>
<p>The main things I contributed to the Atlas project are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I setup the continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline. This
allowed us to quickly and easily integrate changes and release them to users.</li>
<li>I setup the C# and React projects and integrated them so they would work
together both in development and production. Making the developer experience
of the application seamless.</li>
<li>I built the event system that automatically propagated data changes. This  was
one the most difficult technical challenges of the project as it involved
building a custom queuing and event handling system.</li>
<li>I built the real-time system that kept the frontend up to date using web
sockets (SignalR)</li>
<li>I built reusable components for the frontend. Several screens looked very
similar so these components were used across all of them to keep the user
experience consistent.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<h3 id="atlas---results">Atlas - results</h3>
<p>The Atlas project was a great success.</p>
<ul>
<li>We made a 20x performance improvement to the core calculation engine, going
from over 20mins in the old system to just under 1min.</li>
<li>We had a completely re-designed modern user interface that was much easier to
work with.</li>
<li>We now had real-time updates that synchronised across all users. Previously
they would have to manually trigger the calculations and then wait 20 mins and
then re-fresh their screens to get the changes.</li>
<li>Most importantly we saved our users time and made their jobs easier.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<h3 id="atlas---why-is-this-relevant">Atlas - why is this relevant?</h3>
<p>So why is this relevant to what I will be doing at the Allen Institute?</p>
<p>This project gave me invaluable experience in delivering a technical software
project. I feel like this broad experience will allow me to contribute to a
project at any stage of it's development.</p>
<p>For this project I was working closely with subject matter experts to deliver
them a product they will use everyday. In this case I was working with
accountants and financial markets experts, but I'm sure this will translate very
well to working with neuroscientists.</p>
<p>I was working closely with the users of an application. I learnt a lot about how
people interact with software and how you can't assume anything is obvious in UI
design.</p>
<p><strong>Any questions before I move on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<h2 id="rust-ray-tracer">Rust ray tracer</h2>
<p>Now we get to talk about a more interesting, albeit less useful project that I
built. This was a passion project to build a ray tracing engine from scratch.</p>
<p>I've always been interested 3D graphics, mostly thanks to video games but I
became interested in ray tracing in particular when I took a module all about
the math behind it in college. To me it was a fun blend of math, physics, and
computers, all of which are I am very interested in.</p>
<p>Later when I was learning Rust (a new programming language) I was looking for a
good compute intensive project to test my skills and ray tracing seemed like a
good candidate.</p>
<p>It's based on the 'Ray tracing in one weekend' book series, which takes you
through how to build a simple ray tracing engine from scratch in C++, though my
project was all written in Rust. It runs on the CPU so it is not very fast, but
given enough time it can produce some cool images.</p>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<h3 id="what-is-ray-tracing">What is ray tracing?</h3>
<p>Something I should explain in case you are not familiar is; what is ray tracing?</p>
<p>Ray tracing is a method for generating images of digital 3D scenes. It works by
sending out rays from a camera for each pixel on the screen. These rays then
bounce off objects, sometimes multiple times, before eventually ending at a
light source (or not).</p>
<p><strong>Describe diagram</strong>.
(As we can see in the diagram a ray coming from one of these two pixels will
scatter off the ball and hit the light. Other rays coming from this pixel will
scatter off the ground and be blocked from reaching the light source by the ball
creating a shadow in the image.)</p>
<p>Typically multiple rays are sent per pixel all scattering in different
directions. You can imagine that of the rays being scattered off this ball only
a small number are going to end up hitting the light. We average all of these
rays to determine the colour of each pixel.</p>
<p>In more complex scenes rays might interact with multiple objects before hitting
a light source creating complex interactions in the image.</p>
<p>Ray tracing is very computationally intensive compared to other methods of
rendering an image like rasterization. It prioritizes image quality over speed.
Ray tracing is able to produce photorealistic images. Thus it is commonly used
in CGI and visual effects, and sometimes even in video games, though it is often
mixed with other techniques for performance reasons in that case.</p>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<h3 id="ray-tracer-image">Ray tracer image</h3>
<p>So this is an image produced by my ray tracer. The dragon you see in the middle
is the 'Stanford dragon' which is a common 3D model that is used to test 3D
software. It has about 900,000 triangles.</p>
<p>Here we have a glass ball. Note how it inverts the image that we see through it
and how it focuses the light on the ground. This is what I mean when I say ray
tracing is able to produce photorealistic effects. These kinds of details are
very hard to achieve with other rendering means.</p>
<p>A few other things we see are a metal ball here which reflects other objects
around it.</p>
<p>We also have a moving ball over here which exhibits motion blur.</p>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Move to WebGL tab</strong></p>
<h2 id="webgl-project">WebGL project</h2>
<p>The next project I want to talk about is somewhat related. When I found out
about this job I wanted to familiarize myself with WebGL so I decided to
recreate the same scene from my ray tracing engine in the browser using WebGL
(three.js). Which we can see here. This one uses the GPU and classic
rasterization for rendering so we can interact with it!</p>
<p>You'll notice that some objects here are still interacting with other objects in
the scene, like this metal ball. However this is not because we are bouncing
rays around off of multiple objects.</p>
<p>In this case I have setup something called an 'environment map' for the ball. To
do this we essentially take a snapshot of the scene from the perspective of the
ball and then attach it to the ball as a texture. This is very similar to how we
are wrapping the image of the earth on this other ball to make a globe.</p>
<p>This technique has it's limitations however. Notice the glass ball no longer
looks very realistic, this is because we are no longer actually simulating
refraction of light just making the sphere transparent with some distortion.</p>
<p>Also notice the green reflections on the roof of the dragon's mouth, these
should be blocked by the lower jaw but this is not taken into account in this
simple environment map.</p>
<p>This project came together really quickly, I was able to complete it in just a
weekend. I attribute this to the skills that I learnt while building the ray
tracer and my experience in web development.</p>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<h2 id="why-is-this-relevant">Why is this relevant?</h2>
<p>So why is all of this relevant?</p>
<p>I think that building a ray tracing engine from scratch has given me a great
foundational knowledge when it comes to 3D graphics that will translate to
working anywhere in this space. This was demonstrated by my ability to quickly
get up and running with WebGL.</p>
<p>Combining this knowledge with my previous experience of building user interfaces
and web development I think will really enable me to excel in this position at
the Allen Institute.</p>
<p><strong>Any questions before I move on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<h2 id="open-source-work">Open source work</h2>
<p>Something else I want to talk about briefly is some of my open source work. I am
passionate about open source development, I think it is an opportunity to give
back to the communities that I am a part of as well as a great way to learn new
skills. The open science approach of the Allen Institute is one of the things
that has really drawn me to the institute.</p>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Move to Dry Rock tab</strong></p>
<h3 id="dry-rock">Dry Rock</h3>
<p>Dry Rock is an open source project I started about 5 years ago. It is a weather
website for rock climbers. The main problem it is trying to solve is &quot;where
should I go climbing this weekend&quot;?</p>
<p>With rock climbing, as with any outdoor activity, the weather plays a crucial
roll. In particular with rock climbing, rain can really put a damper on your day
out. This often led me to checking the forecast for multiple different places,
trying to compare them to each other and figure out where was going to have the
best weather. Thus Dry Rock was born!</p>
<p>It is designed for high information density so that you can quickly
figure out where the best weather to go climbing is with the least amount of
effort. It is also specifically designed to work well on mobile devices because
that is often how I end up using it.</p>
<p><strong>Demo Dry Rock</strong></p>
<p>Although I originally just created Dry Rock for myself several of my friends and
others in the climbing community are using it too. It's open source so people
can provide feedback and raise issues on GitHub. So far the main feedback I've
received about it is simply to add more places. When people want more of
something I generally take that to mean it's doing a good job.</p>
<p>Something I have added to this recently, which I think demonstrates some of the
things I have learnt since I first started this project, is having multiple ways to do the same thing. One such example of this is when I open this detailed view there are in fact three different ways of closing it.</p>
<ul>
<li>I can click this button</li>
<li>I can click anywhere on the screen that is not part of the modal</li>
<li>I can also hit the back button</li>
</ul>
<p>Now no matter what an individual user thinks is the most intuitive it should
work for them. This is an example of building flexible user interfaces that I referred to earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<h3 id="nwac---avy">NWAC - Avy</h3>
<p>I have also been volunteering for the Northwest Avalanche Center since January,
helping them maintain their Avy app. The app provides avalanche forecasts and
weather data from various avalanche centers in the US. It is used by thousands
of people for backcountry skiing and other winter activities.</p>
<p>As a backcountry skier myself, this app is relevant to my life. I find that
helping out with it is a great way to give back to the community and an
organisation that is trying to keep us all safe in the mountains.</p>
<p>So far I have mostly been fixing bugs, especially on the Android app, as the
rest of the team mostly uses iPhones. This is my first experience working on a
mobile app, but it's been great getting to dabble in this area. As the app is
mostly built using TypeScript I have been able to pick it up quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Any questions before I move on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<h2 id="why-am-i-interested-in-the-allen-institute">Why am I interested in the Allen Institute?</h2>
<p>Hopefully I've done a good job of explaining how my experience will come in
useful at the Allen Institute. However I  want to talk a little bit about why I
am interested in working at the Allen and why this job in particular.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before I am a big fan of open source software and I think this
really aligns with the Allen's open science approach. Being a part of a team
that creates software not just for people here but scientists all over the world
is very appealing to me.</p>
<p>Additionally, as is probably clear from my ray tracing project, I am very
interested in 3D graphics and the opportunity to work in that space
professionally is not one that I could turn down.</p>
<p>A little story to finish off my talk. A few years ago when I was applying for my
first job as a software engineer, my then girlfriend, now wife, was doing her
master's degree in neuroscience and showed me the Allen Brain Atlas (which she
was using in her project). I remember playing with the 3D visualisations of the
atlas and thinking how cool it would be to create software like that, something
that was totally unthinkable to me at that time. Looking back on this now I have
come a long way and hope to make this a reality.</p>
<p><strong>Next slide</strong></p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions?</h2>
<p>Thank you for your time, any more questions for me before we finish up here.</p>
